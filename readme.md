So apparently carter's light switches can be turned on or off but can't be scheduled without the purchase of some kind of bridge/router device. This script lives on my NAS and turns his lights on for him at 8am.

TODO: remove node-schedule and just use a cron job to run the script

running: use pm2 or something idgaf
