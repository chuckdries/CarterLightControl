Carter's cheap ass fucking light switches can be turned on or off with an app but can't be scheduled without buying some fucking bridge or something. This script lives on my NAS and turns his lights on for him.

I spent a whole 20 minutes of my life reading fucking lighting api documentation because he refuses to take down his fuck damn blackout curtain

I used typescript because I fucking can why do you care it's like 2 lines of code.

TODO: remove node-schedule and just use a cron job to run the script

running: use pm2 or something idgaf
